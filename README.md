Using a deep CNN to classify images of sports

This project was a ton of fun for me! I wanted to learn how to build a CNN to classify images. As a massive sports fan, I felt there were no better images to classify than images of different sports. I had a few challenges while building this, but overall, it was a great learning experience for me.

All images were sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/sports-classification?resource=download
In learning how to build the neural network, I followed a tutorial on Youtube, by Nicholas Renotte. This tutorial was used as a baseline, but in order to get proper results for the dataset I am using, I had to do my own research into the best ways to create the neural network. In learning how to use Xception, I followed a tutorial made by MLT Artificial Intelligence
