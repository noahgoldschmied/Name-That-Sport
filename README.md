Using a deep CNN to classify images of sports

This project was a ton of fun for me! I wanted to learn how to build a CNN to classify images. As a massive sports fan, I felt there were no better images to classify than images of different sports. I had a few challenges while building this, but overall, it was a great learning experience for me.

One of the biggest problems I ran into was figuring out how to run the CNN optimally. I knew I needed a GPU, but was unable to get tensorflow to use the one on my machine. For that reason, I had to switch over to Google Colab to effectively run my NN.

In learning how to build the neural network, I followed a tutorial on Youtube, by Nicholas Renotte. This tutorial was used as a baseline, but in order to get proper results for the dataset I am using, I had to do my own research into the best ways to create the neural network. In learning how to use Xception, I followed a tutorial made by MLT Artificial Intelligence. Lastly, in learning how to use streamlit to host the keras model, I followed a tutorial by Burhanuddin Rangwala on Medium, as well as referencing code from others with similar projects.
